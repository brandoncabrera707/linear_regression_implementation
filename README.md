# linear_regression_implementation

This is an attempt to implement linear regression with the ordinary least squares method. 
We take a look at a dataset containing house prices and will predict house prices using features from the dataset.
I implement gradient descent to minimize the cost function and to find the best values for the weights.  
The model is then used to predict house prices and is compared to the true values.
